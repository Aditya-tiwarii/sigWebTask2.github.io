    <h3>
        1. London,England
    </h3>

        <p>While a pandemic recovery is slowly afoot, London held on to its reign as the world’s best city for the sixth year in a row. “Its position at the top, however, has never been more tenuous,” says Resonance. “In our pre-pandemic rankings, ‘best’ had much to do with quality of life factors like Programming, and London is no. 1 for that category, which includes Culture, Restaurants, Shopping, and Nightlife.”
        <br>
        Despite near-total shutdowns in many of those categories, London tentatively reopened this summer. “A full-capacity Wimbledon and Euro 2020 (final match aside) pumped tens of millions into the economy,” says Resonance. “The ‘Let’s Do London’ campaign by London and Partners, which promotes business and investment in the capital, also had some success getting Britons to enjoy their capital without the usual crowds.”
        <br>
        London’s main sights might date back millennia, but the capital’s shops, bars, hotels, and restaurants continue to evolve on an almost weekly basis. Whether you’re outdoorsy, hungry, or bringing a family in tow, there’s a distinct London neighborhood to investigate—and it will likely look different from your last visit. For new hotel options, there’s everything from sleek offerings like the NoMad London to revitalized historic classics such as the Dilly.
